# free-audio-roblox-bot
**THIS BOT IS IN FUCKING SPANISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

this is a old and outdated discord bot that i made.

it uses chinnese roblox cookies for uploading free audios and more stuff

you can change stuff in the file called `keys.json` for setting up your bot's token and shit.

also when you finish setting the shit up in keys.json just run `add-commands.js` so the commands will be added to the guild.

# json tutorial shit
"token" - your discord bot token (used if the host is heroku)

"appId" - your discord bot id


"betaToken" - your alternative discord bot token (used for local testing)

"betaAppId" - your alternative discord bot id


"mainGuild" - your guild id where the bot is located at

"roblosecurity" - the roblosecurity cookie of your chinnese roblox account 

"americanCookie" - the roblosecurity of an alternative american roblox account (used to grab audio files and information)


# why it is public?
roblox has released a new patch that kinda fucks up some stuff about cookies and shit (basically, if you try to use a cookie that isn't created in the same IP it is being used it will be expired) and also the new free audio upload shit update that also kills old audios made me to release this shit

# why the uploading audio shit is SO SHIT?
idk, i was lazy lol

# fdsjfdsg
anyways have fun using this or checking it out, i really wouldn't recommend using this but if you want you can use it.
