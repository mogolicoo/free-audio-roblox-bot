# free-audio-roblox-bot
this is a old and outdated discord bot that i made.
it uses chinnese roblox cookies for uploading shit and more stuff
you can change stuff in the file called `keys.json` for setting up your bot's token and shit.

# json tutorial shit
"token" - your discord bot token (used if the host is heroku)

"appId" - your discord bot id


"betaToken" - your alternative discord bot token (used for local testing)

"betaAppId" - your alternative discord bot id


"roblosecurity" - the roblosecurity cookie of your chinnese roblox account 

"americanCookie" - the roblosecurity of an alternative american roblox account (used to grab audio files and information)


# why it is public?
roblox has released a new patch that kinda fucks up some stuff about cookies and shit (basically, if you try to use a cookie that isn't created in the same IP it is being used it will be expired) and also the new free audio upload shit update that also kills old audios made me to release this shit

# why the uploading audio shit is SO SHIT?
idk, i was lazy lol

anyways have fun using this or checking it out, i really wouldn't recommend using this but if you want you can use it.
